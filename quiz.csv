231,"Which Kubernetes object defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them, but does not create or manage the Pods themselves?",Pod,Deployment,Service,ReplicaSet,DaemonSet,C,"A Service abstracts away the underlying Pods and provides a stable network endpoint. It selects Pods based on labels but does not control their lifecycle.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Kubernetes Resources
232,"What is the primary function of `Prometheus`'s `node_exporter`?",To collect application-specific metrics.,To expose hardware and OS metrics from nodes (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O) for Prometheus to scrape.,To aggregate logs from all nodes.,To send alerts based on node health.,To manage container runtimes on nodes.,B,"The `node_exporter` is a common Prometheus exporter that runs on each node and exposes a wide range of operating system and hardware-level metrics.",Cloud Native Observability,Prometheus
233,"What is the primary benefit of `Ephemeral Volumes` (e.g., `emptyDir` or `CSI ephemeral volumes`)?",They provide long-term, persistent storage for stateful applications.,They are suitable for temporary data that needs to be shared between containers within a Pod or between Pod restarts, but is not persistent beyond the Pod's lifecycle.,They are encrypted by default.,They reduce the overall storage consumption of the cluster.,They can be dynamically resized by applications.,B,"Ephemeral volumes provide short-lived storage that lasts only as long as the Pod (or the specific container that uses CSI ephemeral volumes), ideal for temporary data or cache.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Storage
234,"What is the primary purpose of a `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler` (HPA) using `resource metrics` (e.g., CPU, Memory)?",To adjust the resource requests and limits of existing Pods.,To scale the number of Pod replicas up or down based on the Pods' observed resource utilization.,To add or remove nodes from the cluster.,To manage the number of persistent volumes.,To update container images automatically.,B,"HPA with resource metrics scales the number of Pods based on the CPU or memory utilization observed from the Pods themselves, ensuring workloads meet demand.",Cloud Native Architecture,Autoscaling
235,"What is the main challenge `Service Mesh` addresses regarding inter-service communication compared to traditional methods?",Simplifying application code by offloading concerns like routing, security, and observability from the application layer to the infrastructure layer.,Reducing the number of microservices required.,Eliminating the need for any network configuration.,Providing persistent storage for all services.,Automating database migrations.,A,"A service mesh abstracts common cross-cutting concerns (traffic management, resiliency, security, observability) from application code, allowing developers to focus on business logic.",Container Orchestration,Service Mesh
236,"What is the primary benefit of using `Readiness Gates` in Kubernetes?",To control the order of container startup within a Pod.,To allow external feedback (e.g., from a service mesh or external health check system) to influence a Pod's readiness status, preventing traffic from being sent to unready Pods.,To ensure Pods are always scheduled on specific nodes.,To manage persistent storage for stateful applications.,To encrypt inter-Pod communication.,B,"Readiness gates allow external controllers or systems (like a service mesh's health check or a custom controller) to add custom conditions to a Pod's readiness state, giving them influence over when a Pod is considered ready to receive traffic.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Health Checks
237,"What is the primary role of a `Kubernetes Federation` (now largely superseded by multi-cluster tools)?",To manage a single, large Kubernetes cluster.,To manage multiple Kubernetes clusters as a single logical unit, allowing for global load balancing and cross-cluster resource synchronization.,To replace the Kubernetes API server.,To provide persistent storage across multiple clouds.,To automate container image builds across different regions.,B,"Kubernetes Federation (v1) aimed to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single control plane, enabling features like cross-cluster service discovery and workload distribution. While v1 is deprecated, the concept is relevant to multi-cluster management.",Container Orchestration,Multi-cluster
238,"What is the primary purpose of `kube-scheduler`'s `tolerations`?",To add specific labels to nodes.,To define properties that allow Pods to be scheduled on nodes that have matching taints, overriding the default repulsion.,To limit the resource consumption of Pods.,To provide stable network identities for Pods.,To manage external traffic to the cluster.,B,"Tolerations are applied to Pods and allow (but do not guarantee) the Pod to be scheduled on nodes that have matching taints. This is often used with taints to dedicate nodes or manage node conditions.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Scheduling
239,"Which cloud native principle advocates for building services as independent, self-contained units that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently?",Monolithic Design,Serverless Computing,Microservices,Big Data,Batch Processing,C,"Microservices architecture breaks down applications into loosely coupled, independently deployable services, which is a core cloud native principle for agility and scalability.",Cloud Native Architecture,Cloud Native Principles
240,"What is the main challenge with `Static Provisioning` of PersistentVolumes (PVs) compared to `Dynamic Provisioning`?",It requires more manual intervention from administrators to create PVs for each PVC request.,It is more flexible and automated.,It is less secure for sensitive data.,It does not support different storage types.,It results in higher storage costs.,A,"Static provisioning requires an administrator to pre-create PVs. Dynamic provisioning, enabled by `StorageClass`, automates the creation of PVs based on PVC requests, making storage management more efficient for users.",Container Orchestration,Storage
