# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Main structure and UI (`index.html`)
- **CSV**: Data format for quiz questions (`quiz.csv`)
- **JavaScript**: (Assumed, for dynamic quiz logic within `index.html`)
- **Vercel**: Static site deployment

## Development Setup
- No build tools or frameworks required.
- Edit `index.html` and `quiz.csv` directly.
- Open `index.html` in a browser for local testing.
- Deploy by pushing changes to the repository connected to Vercel.

## Technical Constraints
- No backend/server-side code.
- All logic and data parsing must run in the browser.
- Limited to features supported by static hosting.

## Dependencies
- None beyond standard browser capabilities.
- No external libraries unless included in `index.html`.

## Tool Usage Patterns
- Update quiz content by editing `quiz.csv`.
- Update UI/logic by editing `index.html`.
