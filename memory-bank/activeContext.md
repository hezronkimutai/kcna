# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Establishing foundational project documentation (Memory Bank and Readme).
- Ensuring deployment information is up to date.

## Recent Changes
- Created `Readme.md` with deployment URL.
- Created core Memory Bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.
- Confirmed project is deployed at [https://kcna.vercel.app/](https://kcna.vercel.app/).

## Next Steps
- Review and improve quiz functionality and user interface in `index.html`.
- Update `quiz.csv` with additional or revised questions as needed.
- Expand documentation as the project evolves.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Continue using static hosting and CSV for simplicity.
- Maintain clear separation between content and presentation.
- Prioritize accessibility and ease of use.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- All project context and progress tracked in Memory Bank.
- Documentation updated with every significant change.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Static deployment is effective for simple quiz applications.
- Memory Bank approach ensures continuity and clarity.
