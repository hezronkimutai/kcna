# Progress

## What Works
- The application is deployed and accessible at [https://kcna.vercel.app/](https://kcna.vercel.app/).
- Quiz data is loaded from `quiz.csv`.
- The main interface is provided by `index.html`.
- All core documentation (Memory Bank and Readme) is now established.

## What's Left to Build
- Enhance quiz UI/UX for better user engagement.
- Add more quiz questions or categories to `quiz.csv`.
- Implement additional features if required (e.g., scoring, progress tracking).

## Current Status
- Project is functional and publicly accessible.
- Documentation and deployment are up to date.

## Known Issues
- No major issues identified at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Chose static deployment for simplicity and speed.
- Adopted Memory Bank documentation for project continuity.
